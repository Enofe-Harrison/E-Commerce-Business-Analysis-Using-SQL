# E-Commerce-Business-Analysis-Using-SQL
The main goal was to analyse an online movie rental service, identify trends and provide actionable insights to improve business strategies and operations.
SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis, capable of aggregating data and transforming it into more readable results through tables and queries. 
It allows for efficient data manipulation, retrieval, and analysis, making it an essential skill for data analysts.
For this project, I will utilise PostgreSQL, a robust and versatile relational database management system, to discover and uncover valuable insights from the database.
